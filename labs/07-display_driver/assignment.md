## Preparation tasks (done before the lab at home)

A common way to control multiple displays is to gradually switch between them. We control (connect to supply voltage) only one of the displays at a time, as can be seen [here](https://engineeringtutorial.com/seven-segment-display-working-principle/).

Due to the physiological properties of human vision, it is necessary that the time required to display the whole value is a maximum of 16&nbsp;ms. If we display four digits, then the duration of one of them is 4&nbsp;ms. If we display eight digits, the time is reduced to 2&nbsp;ms, etc.

1. See schematic of the Nexys A7 board, find out the connection of 7-segment displays, and complete the signal timing to display four-digit value `3.142`.
